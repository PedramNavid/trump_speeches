Remarks at the Cross Insurance Center in Bangor, Maine
Thank you.In 24 days, we are going to win this state and we are going to win the White House.We are going to deliver real change that puts America First.We are going to renegotiate our terrible trade deals, reduce surging crime, cut taxes and regulations, lift the restrictions on American energy, end common core, reduce the cost of college, make childcare more affordable, and repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare.Your jobs will come back under a Trump Administration. Your incomes will go up under a Trump Administration. Your taxes will go way down under a Trump Administration. Your companies won't be leaving our country under a Trump Administration.We are going to be a rich country again.We are also going to end government corruption. Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to seek the office of the Presidency  and the media, donors and special interests who support her will do everything they can to cling to their power and prestige at your expense.The Hillary Clinton documents released by WikiLeaks make more clear than ever just how much is at stake in this election.The documents show the Clinton Campaign colluding with the State Department and Justice Department over the investigation into Hillary's illegal email server that put your family and your country in danger.They show how the Clintons ripped off the people of Haiti.They show the Clinton Campaign viciously attacking Catholics and Evangelicals.They also show how the media collaborates and conspires directly with the Clinton Campaign.To cover-up her crimes, Hillary Clinton deleted 33,000 emails  after a Congressional Subpoena  she lied to Congress under oath, she made 13 phones disappear, some with a hammer, and now we learn 2 boxes of evidence mysteriously went missing.Hillary Clinton should have been prosecuted, and gone to jail for her crimes. The FBI and the Department of Justice created a fraud in allowing Hillary Clinton to get away with her terrible crimes  and I guarantee you, the Clintons are laughing at them. The Director's performance in Congress, coupled with Bill Clinton's clandestine meeting on the tarmac in the Attorney General's airplane just prior to decision-time on Hillary  supposedly talking about golf and grandchildren  is perhaps the lowest point in those department's history.Instead of being held accountable, Hillary is running for President in what looks like a rigged election. The election is being rigged by corrupt media, pushing completely false allegations and outright lies, in an effort to elect her President.But we are going to stop it. We are not going to back down. We are not going to let it happen. We are just getting started.Americans have had it with the years, the decades, of Clinton Corruption. They get rich stealing your jobs and shipping them to other countries.This will finally be the year the American people say: Enough is Enough.Speaking in secret to a foreign bank Hillary Clinton said her dream is for totally "open trade and open borders."By "open trade," she means foreign countries can cheat us out of millions of jobs and trillions of dollars.By "open borders," she means totally unlimited immigration.When she thought no one was listening, Hillary Clinton was plotting to destroy the sovereignty of the United States.Either we win the election, or we lose the country.A Trump Administration will secure and defend our borders. And yes, we will build a wall.A wall will not only keep out dangerous cartels and criminals, but it will also keep out the drugs and heroin poisoning our youth.When I won the New Hampshire primary, I promised the people of New Hampshire that I would stop drugs from pouring into your communities. I am now doubling-down on that promise, and can guarantee you  we will not only stop the drugs from pouring in, but we will help all of those people so seriously addicted get the assistance they need to unchain themselves.New Hampshire has one of the highest drug overdose death rates in the country.We have to solve this crisis.I have to give credit to my running mate, Mike Pence, on this issue.Mike increased the mandatory minimum sentences for the most serious drug offenders, while expanding access to treatment and prevention options for those struggling with addiction.We must make similar efforts a priority for the nation.Not too long ago we read about Christopher Honor and Courtney Griffin -- a young Rockingham County couple who died of an overdose within a year of each other. Their story of prescription drugs, heroin, wait times for treatment, and missed opportunity in the court system are a tragic reminder of why we need a plan to end the opioid epidemic.First, we will stop the flow of illegal drugs into the country.The number of heroin seizures on the border has tripled since 2008.I've received the first-ever endorsement of our Border Patrol and ICE officers, and under a Trump Administration, we will work with them to end the flow of drugs across our border for good.We are also going to put an end to Sanctuary Cities, which refuse to turn over illegal immigrant drug traffickers for deportation.We will dismantle the illegal immigrant cartels and violent gangs, and we will send them swiftly out of our country.We will aggressively prosecute traffickers of illegal drugs, and provide law enforcement and prosecutors with the resources and support they need to do their jobs.President Obama has commuted the sentences of record numbers of high level drug traffickers, many of them kingpins, and violent armed traffickers with extensive criminal histories. Hillary Clinton promises to continue and expand this approach, turning our streets back over to gangs, drug cartels, and armed career criminals.Over the last few years this administration has been steadily dismantling the federal criminal justice system. Tens of thousands of drug dealers have been released from prison early, including many illegal immigrants--regardless of their history of violence, or ties to transnational gangs and cartels.Second, we will close the shipping loopholes that China and others are exploiting to send dangerous drugs across our borders in the hands of our own postal service.These traffickers use loopholes in the Postal Service to mail fentanyl and other drugs to users and dealers in the U.S.A Trump administration will crack down on this abuse, and give law enforcement the tools they need to accomplish this mission.Third, we will fix the misguided rules and regulations that have made this problem worse.It is tragedy enough that so many Americans are struggling with life-threatening addiction. We should not compound that tragedy with government policies and bureaucratic rules that make it even harder for them to get help.The FDA has been far too slow to approve abuse-deterring drugs. And when the FDA has approved these medications, the rules have been far too restrictive, severely limiting the number of authorized prescribers as well as the number of patients each doctor can treat.Recovery medications have the potential to save thousands and thousands of lives. We prescribe opioids like Oxycontin freely, but when patients become addicted to those drugs, we stop doctors from giving patients the treatments they medically need.As president, I'd work to lift the cap on the number of patients that doctors can treat, provided they follow safe prescribing practices and proper treatment supervision.At the same time, DEA should reduce the amount of Schedule II opioids (drugs like oxycodone, methadone and fentanyl) that can be made and sold in the U.S. We have 5 percent of the world's population, but use 80 percent of the prescription opioids.Finally, we will give people struggling with addiction access to the help they need.Congress has already taken the first step by passing the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. This legislation is an important step.I would also expand incentives for states and local governments to use drug courts and mandated treatment. These can be a cost effective, appropriate, and humane response to addiction.I would dramatically expand access to treatment slots and end Medicaid policies that obstruct inpatient treatment.I would dramatically expand first responders' and caregivers' access to Narcan, an antidote that treats overdoses and saves thousands of lives.I would also restore accountability to our Veterans Administration. Too many of our brave veterans have been prescribed these dangerous and addictive drugs by a VA that should have been paying them better attention.Together, these steps will ensure that every American struggling with addiction has access to the care and the help that he or she needs.But, if we are going to bring hope back to our communities, we not only have to solve our drug crisis but our economic crisis.The wealth has been raided from our country, leaving behind dilapidated communities, rusted out factories, and shattered dreams.At the center of our economic revival will be fixing our terrible trade deals.47 million Americans are in poverty and 45 million Americans are on Food Stamps.We have nearly an $800 billion annual trade deficit in goods with the world, and the worst so-called recovery since the Great Depression.This is the legacy of Obama-Clinton.The state of New Hampshire has lost nearly 1 in 3 manufacturing jobs since NAFTA, signed by Bill Clinton and supported by Hillary Clinton.Since China entered the World Trade Organization  another Bill and Hillary-backed deal  70,000 factories have shut down or left the United States.That's 15 factories closing a day, on average.We are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world.Companies like Carrier, General Electric, Motorola, Mattel, FiatChrysler, and so many others are moving their jobs to Mexico.Right here in New Hampshire, I visited the Osram Sylvania plant that closed its doors in 2014 and shipped its jobs to China and Mexico.If I win, day one, we are going to announce our plans to renegotiate NAFTA. If we don't get the deal we want, we'll leave NAFTA and start over to get a much better deal.We are going to start making things in America again.As part of our plan to bring back our jobs, we are going to lower our business tax from 35 percent to 15 percent.We will have a 10% tax on money parked overseas, bringing trillions in wealth back into our country.Manufacturers will be able to expense the cost of new investment and equipment, to help make our country more competitive.We will lower taxes massively on all Americans  Hillary will raise your taxes massively.We will become the great jobs magnet of the world.Wages will rise, jobs will return, and factories will come rushing onto our shores.Here are some of the amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017:We are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; defend religious liberty; reduce the cost of tuition; rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; repeal and replace Obamacare; save the 2nd amendment; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.You have 24 days to make every dream you ever dreamed of for your country come true.On November 8th, the arrogance of Washington D.C. will come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter.I am going to fight for every citizen, of every background, from every stretch of this nation  and I am going to fight to bring us all together as Americans.Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.You're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life. You're going to remember this day. This is a movement like you've never seen before. We're going to make history together. You're going to look back at this election, and say this is by far the most important vote I've ever cast for anyone at any time.Once again, we are going to have a government of, by and for the people.We will make America wealthy again.We will make America strong again.We will make America safe again.And we are going to make America great again.
