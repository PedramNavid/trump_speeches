Remarks at the KI Convention Center in Green Bay, Wisconsin
Thank you.In 22 days, we are going to win the state of Wisconsin and we are going to win the White House.Early voting is underway, so make sure to send in your absentee ballots.Together, we are going to deliver real change that puts America First.We are going to renegotiate our terrible trade deals, end illegal immigration, stop the massive inflow of refugees, reduce surging crime, cut taxes and regulations, lift the restrictions on American energy, end common core, and repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare.Your jobs will come back under a Trump Administration. Your incomes will go up under a Trump Administration. Your taxes will go way down under a Trump Administration. Your companies won't be leaving Wisconsin under a Trump Administration.We are also going to end government corruption.Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt person ever to run for President.Newly-released FBI documents made public today reveal just how deep the corruption goes. The under-Secretary of State, Patrick Kennedy, pressured the FBI to un-classify emails from Hillary's illegal server. In other words, the State Department was trying to cover-up Hillary's crime of sending classified information on a server our enemies could easily access by trying to reverse the classification.This is a criminal conspiracy  a conspiracy that included Hillary's deleting and bleaching of 33,000 emails, the disappearance of 13 phones, 2 boxes of email evidence gone missing, and the destruction of laptops in a secret deal with the FBI.Remember, also, that Hillary lied under oath to Congress saying she had never sent or received classified information on her insecure sever, and pretended not to know that the letter "C" meant confidential information that was classified. Hillary then told the FBI she couldn't remember 39 times, and then, in written testimony last week under oath, said she couldn't remember another 21 times.We are witnessing a criminal enterprise that has turned our government into a vehicle for the Clinton's personal profit at your expense.But it gets even worse.The FBI documents show that Under-Secretary of State Patrick Kennedy made the request for altering classification as part of a "quid pro quo." This is felony corruption. Under-Secretary Kennedy needs to resign.Clinton cronies have sacrificed your security, your family's safety, and your country's safety as though it meant nothing at all.This is magnitudes worse than Watergate. And we're going to put an end to it on November 8th.But there's still more. Another series of emails shows top officials in the Clinton campaign scheming to take massive sums of money from foreign lobbyists. One of the emails from a top Hillary official said, quote, "take the money!!" with two exclamation points. This is money bundled by people registered as lobbyists on behalf of foreign governments.Remember, we are competing in a rigged election  the media is trying to rig the election by giving credence to false stories that have no validity and making it front page news, only to poison the minds of the American voters. The media is an extension of the Clinton Campaign, as WikiLeaks proved  Hillary even got the questions and answers in advance of a major debate.A new report from the Center for Public Integrity shows that 96% of so-called journalists and reporters who donated this cycle gave their money to Hillary Clinton. They even want to try and rig the election at the polling booths, where so many cities are corrupt and voter fraud is all too common.The following comes straight from Pew Research.QUOTE: "Approximately 24 millionone of every eightvoter registrations in the United States are no longer valid or are significantly inaccurate."QUOTE: "More than 1.8 million deceased individuals are listed as voters."QUOTE: "Approximately 2.75 million people have registrations in more than one state."Then there is the issue of illegal immigrants voting. The following comes from a 2014 report from the Washington Post. The article was entitled: "could non-citizens decide the November election?" Here are some excerpts.QUOTE: "More than 14 percent of non-citizens in both the 2008 and 2010 samples indicated that they were registered to vote."QUOTE: "Because non-citizens tended to favor Democrats (Obama won more than 80 percent of the votes of non-citizens in the 2008 sample), we find that this participation was large enough to plausibly account for Democratic victories in a few close elections. Non-citizen votes could have given Senate Democrats the pivotal 60th vote needed to overcome filibusters in order to pass health-care reform and other Obama administration priorities in the 111th Congress. It is also possible that non-citizen votes were responsible for Obama's 2008 victory in North Carolina. Obama won the state by 14,177 votes, so a turnout by 5.1 percent of North Carolina's adult non-citizens would have provided this victory margin."Our system is also rigged by the donors, giving hundreds of millions to Hillary Clinton's campaign.The reason Hillary Clinton pushes for NAFTA, or the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and for completely open borders, is because her international donors control her every move.If we let the Clinton Cartel run this government, history will record that 2017 was the year America lost its independence.We will not let that happen.It is time to drain the swamp in Washington, D.C.That is why I am proposing a package of ethics reforms to make our government honest once again.When Bill Clinton came into office, he signed an executive order saying if you work for the White House or a federal agency, you can't lobby the government for 5 years after you leave. But then, President Clinton did what the Clintons always do  he rigged the system on his way out. Clinton lifted the executive order so the Clintons and their cronies like John Podesta could start raking in cash.So, here is what I am announcing tonight. First: I am going to re-institute a 5-year ban on all executive branch officials lobbying the government for 5 years after they leave government service. I am going to ask Congress to pass this ban into law so that it cannot be lifted by executive order.Second: I am going to ask Congress to institute its own 5-year ban on lobbying by former members of Congress and their staffs.Third: I am going to expand the definition of lobbyist so we close all the loopholes that former government officials use by labeling themselves consultants and advisors when we all know they are lobbyists.Fourth: I am going to issue a lifetime ban against senior executive branch officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government.And Fifth: I am going to ask Congress to pass a campaign finance reform that prevents registered foreign lobbyists from raising money in American elections.Not only will we end our government corruption, but we will end the economic stagnation.My plan for the economy can be summed up in three simple words: jobs, jobs, jobs.At the center of my plan will be fixing our terrible trade deals.47 million Americans are in poverty and 45 million Americans are on Food Stamps.We have nearly an $800 billion annual trade deficit in goods with the world, and the worst so-called recovery since the Great Depression.It's the Clintons who gave us NAFTA, and the Clintons who gave us China's entry into the World Trade Organization.Briggs & Stratton has cut thousands of Wisconsin manufacturing jobs and moved them to China.GE Healthcare recently closed its Milwaukee location and shipped the jobs to Mexico.Johnson Controls shuttered its plants in Milwaukee and West Allis and moved the jobs to Mexico and China.The list goes on and on.We are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world.A Trump Administration is going to renegotiate NAFTA, stand up to China, and stop the jobs from leaving our country.As part of our plan to bring back our jobs, we are going to lower our business tax from 35 percent to 15 percent.We will be a rich nation once again.But to be a rich country, we must also be a safe country.National Security begins at the border.Speaking in secret to a foreign bank Hillary Clinton said her dream is for totally "open trade and open borders."By "open trade," she means foreign countries can cheat us out of millions of jobs and trillions of dollars.By "open borders," she means totally unlimited immigration.In a secret speech to Goldman Sachs, she said citizens who want to control immigration are "Un-American."So Hillary thinks most of the country is either deplorable, irredeemable, un-American, racist, or basement dwellers supporting Bernie Sanders.Hillary's plan includes an open border with the Middle East  meaning generations of radicalism and terrorism spreading and growing within our shores.So let me state this as clearly as I can. If I'm elected President I am going to keep Radical Islamic Terrorists out of our country.We will also stop the crisis of illegal immigration.A Trump Administration will secure and defend our borders. And yes, we will build a wall.We have the first-ever endorsement from our ICE and Border Patrol officers.As Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton allowed thousands of criminal aliens to be released because their home countries wouldn't take them back.The ICE officers described Hillary's proposal as, quote, the most radical immigration proposal in U.S. history." Here is a summary of the Hillary plan:--Support for Sanctuary Cities--Social Security, Medicare and lifetime welfare for illegal immigrants by making them all citizens--Obamacare for illegal immigrants--No deportation of visa overstays--Expanding catch-and-release on the border--Expanding President Obama's unconstitutional executive amnesty, including instant work permits for millions of illegal workers--Freeing even more criminal aliens by expanding Obama's non-enforcement directives--A 550% increase in Syrian refugeesEither we win this election, or we lose the country.Under a Trump Administration, it's going to be America First.Here are some of the amazing things we are going to do for our country starting in 2017:We are going to have the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; defend religious liberty; provide school choice to every low-income child in America; rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; support the men and women of law enforcement; repeal and replace Obamacare; save the 2nd amendment; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.You have 22 days to make every dream you ever dreamed of for your country come true.On November 8th, the arrogance of Washington D.C. will come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter.I am going to fight for every citizen, of every background, from every stretch of this nation.I'm going to fight for every child living in poverty. I'm going to fight for every mom who lost her child to illegal immigration, and drugs and gang violence.I'm going to fight for every community whose jobs and dreams have been ripped out and shipped to other countries.I'm going to fight for every person in this country who believes government should serve the people  not the donors.And I am going to fight to bring us all together as Americans.Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.You're going to look back at this rally for the rest of your life. You're going to remember this day. This is a movement like you've never seen before. You're going to look back at this election, and say this is by far the most important vote you've ever cast for anyone at any time.Once again, we are going to have a government of, by and for the people.We Will Make America Wealthy Again.We Will Make America Strong Again.We Will Make America Safe Again.And We Will Make America Great Again.
